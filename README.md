## Overview

XpandX is a cross-chain perpetual decentralized exchange (perp DEX) and lending protocol built on the Arbitrum, Starknet blockchain.&#x20;

As a perp DEX, XpandX offers users the ability to trade perpetual contracts on various assets without an expiration date. Perpetual contracts allow traders to speculate on the price movements of an underlying asset, such as cryptocurrencies, commodities, or indices, without the need to own the asset itself. This trading mechanism provides traders with flexibility and enables them to profit from both rising and falling markets.

XpandX leverages the capabilities of Arbitrum to provide a decentralized and efficient trading experience. Arbitrum's blockchain infrastructure ensures fast transaction confirmation times, low fees, and high throughput, allowing for seamless and cost-effective trading on XpandX.

One of the key features of XpandX is its cross-chain functionality. By leveraging Arbitrum's cross-chain capabilities, XpandX enables users to trade perpetual contracts that are based on assets from different blockchain networks. This means that users can access a wide range of assets and markets beyond the Arbitrum blockchain ecosystem. The cross-chain integration enhances liquidity and expands trading opportunities, as users can participate in markets that were previously isolated.

Additionally, XpandX prioritizes security and trustlessness by utilizing smart contracts and decentralized protocols on the Arbitrum blockchain. By eliminating the need for intermediaries, users retain control over their funds and can engage in peer-to-peer trading directly.

The user interface of XpandX is designed to be user-friendly, making it easy for both experienced traders and newcomers to navigate the platform. It provides real-time market data, order book information, and trading charts, empowering users to make informed trading decisions.

Overall, XpandX on the Arbitrum blockchain aims to provide a decentralized and efficient trading experience for perpetual contracts. By leveraging Arbitrum's cross-chain capabilities, the DEX offers users access to a wide range of assets, while maintaining the security and trustlessness of decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems.
