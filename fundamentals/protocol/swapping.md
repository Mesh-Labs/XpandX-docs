# Swapping

### Introduction

Swapping is the coolest way to use the XpandX protocol. It's super easy for anyone to do it! All you have to do is choose a TIP3.0 token that you already have and pick the token you want to trade it for. When you make the swap, your tokens will be sold and you'll get the same amount of the tokens you want, but with a small fee taken out. That fee goes to the awesome people who provide the liquidity. The best part is that swapping with XpandX is open to everyone, so you don't need anyone's permission to do it.

Just a friendly reminder: If you use a website to swap through the XpandX protocol, there might be some extra rules and stuff. It could be a bit different from using the XpandX protocol directly. If you want to know more about the differences, you can check out [What is XpandX](https://docs.xpandx.xyz/).

Swapping with the XpandX protocol is really unique because it doesn't work like regular trades where orders are matched up one by one. Instead, it happens against a cool pool of money called liquidity. The people who provide that money earn fees based on how much they put in. It's a win-win situation for everyone involved!

### Price Impact&#x20;

In a regular market, when someone wants to buy a lot of something, they might end up paying a higher price. Let's say they buy from one person and then another person, but the second person charges more. So the final price they pay is somewhere in the middle.

The same thing happens when you do a swap using an automated market. The value of one thing compared to another keeps changing while the swap is happening. So the final price you get is somewhere between the starting and ending prices.

This happens every time you do a swap on the XpandX protocol because that's how it's designed.

The amount of stuff available at different prices can be different, and that affects the price impact. If there's a lot available at a certain price, the price impact is lower. But if there's not much available, the price impact is higher.

You can see an estimate of the price impact on the XpandX interface in real-time. If the price impact is really high, there will be a warning. So whenever you do a swap, you can check and see how it might affect the price.

### Slippage&#x20;

Another important thing to know about when doing swaps with the XpandX protocol is slippage. Slippage is when the price you expect to get for your swap might change while your transaction is waiting to be processed.

When you send a transaction to Venom, it takes time to get processed. The order in which transactions are processed depends on the "gas" fee you offer. The higher the fee, the faster it gets processed. But if you offer a lower fee, it might take a while for your transaction to go through. And during this waiting time, the prices might change because other people are also doing swaps.

To account for this, there's something called slippage tolerance. It means there's a range of price changes that are acceptable. As long as the price you get for your swap is within that range, like maybe 1% higher or lower than expected, the transaction will go through. But if the price goes outside that range, the transaction will fail, and the swap won't happen.

It's similar to when you want to buy something in a regular store, but you have to wait a bit. The price might change while you're waiting, so you have to be okay with that.
