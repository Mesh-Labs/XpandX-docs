# Rewards

### Compounding vs Claiming

There are two options for rewards: "Compound" and "Claim."&#x20;

Compounding will stake your pending Multiplier Points and Escrowed XPX rewards, increasing the amount of rewards you receive.&#x20;

Claiming will transfer any pending Escrowed XPX rewards and ETH/STRK rewards to your wallet. If you compound or stake your Escrowed XPX tokens, you can unstake them for vesting at any time later on.&#x20;

### Escrowed XPX&#x20;

Escrowed XPX (esXPX) can be used in two ways:

1. Staked for rewards, similar to regular XPX tokens.
2. Vested to become actual XPX tokens over a period of one year.&#x20;

Each staked Escrowed XPX token will earn the same amount of Escrowed XPX and ETH/STRK rewards as a regular XPX token.&#x20;

Please note that Escrowed XPX (esXPX) is not meant to be transferable unless you are doing so. The amount of XPX or LXPX required to vest esXPX is unique per account and capped to the rewards received by that account. Please do not buy esXPX off the market or OTC as you will not be able to vest them.

### Vesting&#x20;

Escrowed XPX (esXPX) tokens can be converted into XPX tokens through vesting, which can be accessed on the page.&#x20;

When vesting is initiated, the average amount of XPX or LXPX tokens used to earn the esXPX rewards will be reserved.&#x20;

For example, if you staked 1000 XPX and earned 100 esXPX tokens, then to vest 100 esXPX tokens, 1000 XPX tokens will be reserved. To vest 50 esXPX, 500 XPX tokens will be reserved. Please note that this is an example, and the actual ratio depends on the average staked amount and rewards earned for your account.&#x20;

esXPX tokens that have been unstaked and deposited for vesting will not earn rewards.&#x20;

However, staked tokens reserved for vesting will continue to earn rewards. After initiating vesting, the esXPX tokens will be converted into XPX every second and will fully vest over 365 days. esXPX tokens that have been converted into XPX are claimable at any time.

If a user sells XPX or LXPX tokens and would like to vest their esXPX rewards later on, they would need to re-buy the XPX or LXPX tokens. XPX, esXPX, and Multiplier Points can be used interchangeably for the required reserve amount. Depositing into the vesting vault while existing vesting is ongoing is supported. Tokens that are reserved for vesting cannot be unstaked or sold. To unreserve the tokens, use the "Withdraw" button on the page. Please note that partial withdrawals are not supported, so withdrawing will unreserve all tokens and pause vesting. All esXPX tokens that have been vested into XPX will remain as XPX tokens.

### Multiplier Points&#x20;

Multiplier Points reward long-term holders without inflation.&#x20;

When you stake XPX, you receive Multiplier Points every second at a fixed rate of 100% APR. For example, staking 1000 XPX for one year would earn you 1000 Multiplier Points.&#x20;

Multiplier points can be staked for fee rewards by pressing the "Compound" button on the page. Each multiplier point will boost ETH/STRK APRs at the same rate as a regular XPX token.&#x20;

When XPX or Escrowed XPX tokens are unstaked, the proportional amount of Multiplier Points is burnt. For example, if 1000 XPX is staked and 500 Multiplier Points have been earned so far, unstaking 300 XPX would burn 150 (300 / 1000 \* 500) Multiplier Points.&#x20;

The burn will apply to the total amount of Multiplier Points, including both staked and unstaked Multiplier Points.&#x20;

To transfer staked tokens without burning Multiplier Points, use the Transfer button on Earn page.&#x20;

The "Boost Percentage" shown on the page represents your individual boost amount from Multiplier Points. For example, if the ETH APR is 10% and you have $10,000 worth of XPX and esXPX, your rewards would be $1000 annualized. If you additionally have an amount of Multiplier Points equivalent to 20% of your total amount of XPX and Escrowed XPX, your "Boost Percentage" would display as 20%, and you would get an extra $200 of ETH rewards annualized. The "Boost Percentage" is calculated from the ratio of Multiplier Points to your total amount of staked XPX:&#x20;

Boost Percentage = 100 \* (Staked Multiplier Points) / (Staked XPX + Staked esXPX)&#x20;

An example: 100 \* (4.5656) / (7.54 + 2.00) = 47.85% â€‹&#x20;

### Distribution Rate&#x20;

Escrowed XPX will be distributed to staked XPX and LXPX according to the schedule in the latest .&#x20;

Rewards are distributed every second to staked tokens.&#x20;

Reward rates will be evaluated each month and may be subject to changes. Any modifications will be announced at least 7 days in advance before being implemented.&#x20;

### Summary&#x20;

A summary of rewards and mechanics:&#x20;

* XPX: Earns WETH/STRK, esXPX, and Multiplier Points when staked.&#x20;
* esXPX: Earns WETH/STRK, esXPX, and Multiplier Points when staked.&#x20;
* Multiplier Points: Boosts WETH/STRK APRs when staked.&#x20;
* LXPX: Earns WETH/STRK, esXPX, automatically staked on mint.
