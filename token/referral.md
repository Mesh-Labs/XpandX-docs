# Referral

### How it Works:&#x20;

To create a referral code:

1. Visit the Referrals page.
2. Go to the Affiliates tab.
3. Generate a referral code using a combination of letters, numbers, and underscores.

After creating your code, click on the copy icon next to it to obtain your referral link. The link will look similar to this: [https://](https://xpandx.finance/#/?ref=)app.xpandx.xyz/ref=\<yourwallet>.

Share this link on various platforms such as Twitter or Telegram. When someone clicks on your link, your referral code will be associated with their account. As the user executes trades, they will receive a discount, and you will earn rebates from their trading fees. The referral code remains stored in the contract, even if the user switches devices for future trades.&#x20;

The discounts and rebates will be distributed in STRK/WETH, and you can track your rebate history on the Referrals page.&#x20;

### Tiers

The referral program implements a tier system to prevent self-referrals and ensure that referrers receive rebates for the users they bring to the platform.&#x20;

* Tier 1: Traders receive a 5% discount, and referrers earn a 5% rebate.&#x20;
* Tier 2: Traders receive a 10% discount, and referrers earn a 10% rebate.&#x20;
* Tier 3: Traders receive a 10% discount, referrers earn a 15% rebate paid in STRK, and a 5% rebate paid in esXPX.&#x20;

Anyone can create a Tier 1 code. To upgrade your code to Tier 2 or Tier 3:

* Tier 2: Have at least 15 active users utilizing your referral codes per week, with a combined weekly trading volume exceeding $5 million.
* Tier 3: Have at least 30 active users using your referral codes per week, with a combined weekly trading volume surpassing $25 million. Rebates and discounts apply to opening and closing fees for leverage trading.&#x20;

XPANDX charges a 0.1% fee for opening and closing trades, with no price impact or token spread for assets like WBTC and WETH. Rebates are calculated before applying user discounts, ensuring that referrers earn rebates on the entire maker fee and on trades that would otherwise incur spread on other exchanges.&#x20;

Consequently, referrers can expect to earn rebates equivalent to those offered by other referral programs, based on trading volume on XPANDX.&#x20;

Wallet providers and other protocols are also eligible for Tier 2 and Tier 3 rewards.
